  title: "About — The Story of Rocket Blueprint"
  archetype: "The Architect of Clarity"
  # This blueprint tells our origin story in narrative form.
  # Use it for the website's 'About' section, investor decks, and brand onboarding materials.
  # The language is designed to be parsed for tone, voice, and rhythm consistency across all content.

  # Narrative Summary:
  story: >
    Rocket Blueprint was born from a single realization — most companies are not broken,
    they’re just out of sync. Departments speak different languages. Marketing feels detached.
    Sales pushes one truth, while design tells another. The result isn’t failure — it’s noise.
    And noise kills momentum.

    We built Rocket Blueprint to restore coherence — to architect the calm that power needs
    before it moves. We believe clarity isn’t a deliverable, it’s a force — a living gravity that
    aligns every message, mission, and moment around a single intelligent core.

    At our center is the Blueprint DNA — the collective intelligence that turns brands into
    living systems. Every color, every word, every decision traces back to it. From this DNA,
    AI and humans co-create in perfect rhythm, bringing resonance to every interaction.

    We are not an agency. We are an alignment engine — a company that teaches businesses to
    think, speak, and build in sync with themselves. When you work with Rocket Blueprint,
    you don’t get a website or a campaign — you get your voice, harmonized.

  # Core Values — what drives every action.
  values: ["Clarity", "Alignment", "Resonance", "Integrity", "Momentum"]

  # Emotional Signature — how we make people feel.
  feeling: "Calm confidence — the relief of understanding and the thrill of focus."

  # Promise — what we stand behind publicly.
  promise: "We don’t sell clarity. We install it."

  # Presence — what clients notice instantly.
  presence: "Every interaction feels orchestrated — precise, intelligent, human."

  # Motto — our guiding phrase for storytelling and brand rhythm.
  motto: "Clarity moves everything."
